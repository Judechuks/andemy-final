          <p>I,m Monye Jude, and I'm here to help you reach the success that's inside you. I've been coaching clients for success for over 25 years, and have a string of success stories behind me. My philosophy is not aimed at teaching my clients how to be successful, but teaching them the skills they need to capitalize on their own potential.</p>

          <h2 class="about-sub-title">Experience & Education</h2>
          <p>I've worked with over 800 coaching clients, in 23 counties, over 4 continents. What this has shown me is not only that success can happen anywhere, but that the building blocks of success are within everyone, wherever they come from. </p>
          <p>I am never satisfied with my work until my clients have achieved the goals that we set out together. It's this determination and refusal to let anyone down that has become my hallmark in the industry. </p>
